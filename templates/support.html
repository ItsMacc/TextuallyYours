        <h2>Common Issues & Solutions</h2>

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>1. How do I install the app?</h3>
            <p>Visit our <a href="https://github.com/ItsMacc/TextuallyYours">GitHub page</a> for detailed instructions.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="faq">
            <h3>2. The installer shows an error while trying to connect</h3>
            <p>
                First, ensure that you have a stable internet connection and avoid using a hotspot if possible. If you must use a hotspot, make sure it's not restricting connections. If you’re installing the app for the first time, it might be helpful to have the other person create the room and then attempt to join. That is, select the create button if you decided to join first, and let the other user (who joined the room) create it. While the software should function properly even with a hotspot, sometimes network settings can prevent connections. If the issue persists, reach out to us at <a href="mailto:textuallyyoursco@gmail.com">textuallyyoursco@gmail.com</a>.

            <h3>3. Can I reset my connection?</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, connections made once are permanent. It was an intentional software design. Think carefully before making your choice!

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>4. Why do I have to keep changing the address so often?</h3>
            <p>
                The software ensures your messages are stored securely and privately, without relying on external clouds or servers. For security purposes, the protocol it uses requires frequent changes to the address to protect your data and maintain safe communication. This approach enhances your privacy and ensures that your messages remain confidential.

        <div class="faq">
            <h3>5. Will I be able to text the other person with a different device?</h3>
            <p>
                Okay, so this is where the "one connection" rule kind of breaks. Since all data is stored on your device, getting a totally new device will allow you to make a new connection with anyone. If you make a connection with the same person, unfortunately, you will lose all the message history. We are working on a way to work around this by implementing a login approach, but that leads to storing information on clouds, servers etc.

            <h3>6. How can I ensure my messages are secure?</h3>
            <p>
                Your messages are encrypted locally before they leave your device, ensuring they remain private. We don’t rely on external servers to store your messages, keeping them as secure as possible. Make sure you’re using a secure internet connection and regularly update the app to benefit from the latest security features.

            <h3>6. Can I trust the app? (Unverified Developer)</h3>
            <p>
                Yes, the app is designed to provide secure communication between two users. The code is built with privacy in mind and does not contain any malicious intent. Messages exchanged within the app are not accessible to anyone other than the participants in the conversation. 
                <br>
                While the app is safe to use, please note that it is currently "unverified" due to the developer not having the funds to purchase a certification (which can cost around $500 per year for Windows and Mac platforms). We’re working on improving the app, and appreciate your understanding and trust.

            <h3>7. Why is there no mobile app?</h3>
            <p>
                Currently, there is no mobile app for Textually Yours. The way the app is designed, with the "one-connection" rule and messages being stored locally without relying on servers, makes it challenging to implement on mobile platforms. The code would need to be adapted for both Android and iOS, which involves creating separate codebases for each platform.
                <br>
                While we understand the desire for a mobile version, developing one would require significant additional effort and resources. We're focusing on providing the best possible experience on desktop for now, but we may consider mobile development in the future depending on demand and feasibility.
