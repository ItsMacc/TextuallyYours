        <h2>What, Why, How, When and Where</h2>
        <div class="text">
            Hi. I’m Mac, the creator of Textually Yours. (Yes, it feels a little odd calling myself that, but here we are.) I’ll be your guide through this journey—let me tell you how, why, and probably way too much about how this little idea came to life. Spoiler alert: it includes a lot of late-night coding and some (very) questionable decisions. Basically, this is going to be me yapping about every little detail of this app, so if you’re not into that, now is probably a good time to you know, leave.
        </div>

        <h3>What & Why</h3>
        <div class="text">
            If you haven’t already checked out what Textually Yours is all about, I highly recommend doing that first—it’ll make this whole “WHY” part make a lot more sense. But since you're here, I'm guessing you’re wondering: “Why would anyone want features like no unsending messages, real-time typing previews, or event planning?” Well, buckle up—let me take you on a little journey.<br>
        
            Once upon a time, there was this person I’ll call Pineapple (because, why not?). Now, full disclosure: I’m absolutely terrible at texting, especially with the opposite gender. Honestly, I’m a walking typo.Pineapple, on the other hand, was the complete opposite—sharp, confident, and could text without overthinking every word.<br>
        
            Every time we chatted, I’d second-guess everything I sent. I’d type, delete, rewrite, second-guess again... you get the idea. I even unsent half of my messages, thinking that was somehow a good solution. Spoiler alert: it wasn’t. Pineapple got <b>very</b> frustrated and swore never to talk to me again if I kept unsending 80% of my texts. So, I stopped.<br>
        
            And that's how the <b>no unsending messages</b> rule came into play. Pineapple basically wished there was a way to make the unsend button disappear forever. So I made it disappear.<br>
        
            But of course, that wasn’t the end of it. I’d still write messages, stare at them for 30 seconds, then delete the whole thing. Meanwhile, Pineapple could see I was typing. Cue the complaints: “Just send it already!” So, I thought, “Why not let Pineapple see exactly what I’m typing—even if I don’t send it?” That, my friends, is how <b>real-time typing preview</b> was born.<br>
        
            Now, as for <b>event planning</b>—that wasn’t really my thing. All credit goes to Pineapple. I wasn’t the ‘let’s organize a date’ type, but Pineapple absolutely loved organizing everything under the sun. Even though we never really planned anything together, I figured if Pineapple enjoyed planning so much, why not make it easier for the people who actually like that sort of thing?<br>
        
            And finally, the one connection rule. Why just one person? Well, the answer is simple. One person means total dedication. It means you’re all in. And trust me, I was.<br>
        
            So there you have it: Textually Yours—an app born from my endless second-guessing, Pineapple’s patience, and a whole lot of slightly awkward text conversations. It’s basically my alter ego, but in app form.

        <h3>How and When</h3>
        <div class="text">
            So, with all these ideas in mind, I decided to create an app for Pineapple—one that removed all the things I did that annoyed her (and believe me, there were plenty). And thus, I started coding. I broke the project into three phases: <b>The Backend</b> (the logic behind the app), <b>The User Interface</b> (how the app looks), and <b>Testing</b> (which, let’s be real, is self-explanatory). 
        
            I started in November, and little did I know, this journey would cost me 300+ hours of my life. My original goal was to finish by Valentine’s Day (OKAY, I KNOW, CRINGE, BUT STILL)—so, with the clock ticking, I dove into coding. Minutes turned into hours, hours into days, and days into weeks. 
        
            Phase 1 of the project—things like saving messages, the logic behind connecting with just one person, and so on—went surprisingly fast. Phase 2, the User Interface, was pretty smooth as well. I thought, "This isn’t so bad, I’ve got this." But then came testing. And testing... well, that’s where I really started to question all of my life choices.
        
            Integrating both phases together was BY FAR the hardest thing I had to do. The code just refused to cooperate. I tried everything. Nothing worked. But once I finally got the basic logic to click, the other features came at a price—namely, my soul.
        
            <b>Dynamic Typing</b>? Oh, that was an absolute beast. It took everything I had to make that work. And as for <b>Event Planning</b>? Let’s just say it was the bane of my existence for a while. I was ready to throw in the towel a few times, but with sheer willpower (and lots of late nights), I pushed through.
        
            And now, here we are—Textually Yours, born from countless hours of coding, debugging, and questioning all my life decisions. But hey, at least it’s here, and I can proudly say: It was worth it.
